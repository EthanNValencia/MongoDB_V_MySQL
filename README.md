# Inspiration

During my academic journey, I briefly touched on document-based databases in an advanced database course. So I am beginning this research project with little knowledge. I've heard from several sources that the more data that is being stored the more MongoDB is superior to MySQL. I also want to see how well they perform in smaller data scenarios too. I want to verify for myself the veracity of these sentiments. Since I have been exposed to questions related to this topic on multiple occasions in a professional context, I think this is a worthwhile endeavor. 

# Objective

Compare the CPU time required to perform similar CRUD operations in MongoDB and MySQL across varying sizes of datasets. 

## Technologies

MongoDB, MySQL, Python, Sublime Text 3, MongoDBCompass, MongoDB Shell, MySQL Workbench, Notepad++,

## Anticipated High-Level Tasks

* Create and connect to MySQL database
* Create and connect to MongoDB database
* Contrast differences in how MongoDB and MySQL perform work
* Create a data generator (can I do this in a generic way?)
* Write data to a text file
* Chart data (excel or seaborn?)
* Focus on percentages (comparative percentages would probably tell the best story)
* ... will be adding more.
